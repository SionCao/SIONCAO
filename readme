# PROJECT TITLE： Temporal Error

## Short Description
Temporal Error is a computational artwork that explores moments when time feels subtly wrong.
Through immediate sound and delayed visual feedback, the work invites viewers to experience time not as a smooth flow, 
but as something shaped, calculated, and occasionally unsettled by a computational system.

## Concept / Intent
Temporal Error investigates how small temporal mismatches can alter our sense of presence and causality.
The work focuses on moments when an action and its response fail to align, producing a subtle feeling of disorientation.
Rather than treating time as a continuous and neutral flow, the project frames time as something constructed by a computational system — calculated, 
delayed, and mediated through code. By separating sound and image in time, the work reveals how technical decisions shape embodied experience and our perception of the present moment.

##Technology Used
The work is developed using p5.js (JavaScript) as a browser-based computational environment, with additional support from the p5.sound library for audio playback and manipulation.
The system runs in real time within a web browser and is designed for audiovisual interaction.

Temporal behavior in the work is structured using discrete timing logic rather than continuous response.
System timing and delays are controlled using the millis() function in p5.js, allowing the work to introduce intentional pauses, interruptions, and misalignments between action and response.

Visual output is generated through live webcam input and processed using the image() function.
Previous frames are stored in a JavaScript array functioning as a temporal frame buffer, enabling delayed re-rendering of visual information.
This buffering mechanism allows the image to appear consistently out of sync with the present moment.

Sound operates on a separate temporal layer.
Using p5.SoundFile, audio responds immediately to interaction, creating an intentional contrast between sonic immediacy and visual delay.
This separation between sound and image is central to the work’s exploration of time as a constructed and interruptible experience.

The project draws technical inspiration from existing p5.js glitch-based sketches and educational resources, including timing and scheduling approaches discussed 
by The Coding Train, as well as official documentation from p5.js and MDN Web Docs.

## How to Run / Install
Temporal Error runs in a web browser and uses the webcam and audio system in real time. Open the project (via GitHub Pages or a local server), 
allow camera access when prompted, and click once to enable audio. Interaction is controlled by clicking and holding the mouse: sound responds immediately to the duration of the press, 
while visual disruption appears only after a short, system-controlled delay. Releasing the mouse causes the system to gradually return to its baseline state.

The work is presented as a single-screen audiovisual setup.
A laptop with an active webcam is positioned facing the participant, with audio played through speakers or headphones so the immediate sound response is clearly audible. 
The piece is designed to be experienced by one participant at a time, standing close enough that the delayed and fragmented image is perceived as feedback to their own action rather than as a separate video.

## Requirements
Operating System: macOS Tahoe，P5js, Visual Studio Code Version
Browser: Google Chrome (recommended for webcam and audio handling)
Hardware: Laptop or desktop computer / Built-in or external webcam / Speakers or headphones / Projector
Libraries / Frameworks: p5.js / p5.sound
